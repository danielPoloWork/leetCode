# LEET CODE CHALLANGE
[LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/) is one of te best platforms to help us enhance our skills, expand our knowledge and 
prepare for technical interviews.

In this public repository you may find some solutions I approached to LeetCode challenge problems. LeetCode is the 
golden standard for technical interviews. LeetCode problems are widely used during technical interviews at companies 
like Amazon, Apple, Cisco, Facebook, Google, Hulu, Intel, Jet, Leap Motion, Stripe, Uber.
