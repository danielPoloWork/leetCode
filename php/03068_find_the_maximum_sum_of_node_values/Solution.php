/**
 * There exists an undirected tree with n nodes numbered 0 to n - 1. You are given a 0-indexed 2D integer array edges of
 * length n - 1, where edges[i] = [ui, vi] indicates that there is an edge between nodes ui and vi in the tree. You are
 * also given a positive integer k, and a 0-indexed array of non-negative integers nums of length n, where nums[i]
 * represents the value of the node numbered i.
 *
 * Alice wants the sum of values of tree nodes to be maximum, for which Alice can perform the following operation any
 * number of times (including zero) on the tree. Choose any edge [u, v] connecting the nodes u and v, and update their
 * values as follows:
 * - nums[u] = nums[u] XOR k
 * - nums[v] = nums[v] XOR k
 *
 * Return the maximum possible sum of the values Alice can achieve by performing the operation any number of times.
 *
 * - Hint 1: Select any node as the root.
 * - Hint 2: Let dp[x][c] be the maximum sum we can get for the subtree rooted at node x, where c is a boolean
 * representing whether the edge between node x and its parent (if any) is selected or not.
 * - Hint 3: dp[x][c] = max(sum(dp[y][cy]) + v(nums[x], sum(cy) + c)) where cy is 0 or 1. When sum(cy) + c is odd,
 * v(nums[x], sum(cy) + c) = nums[x] XOR k. When sum(cy) + c is even, v(nums[x], sum(cy) + c) = nums[x].
 * - Hint 4: Thereâ€™s also an easier solution - does the parity of the number of elements where nums[i] XOR k > nums[i].
